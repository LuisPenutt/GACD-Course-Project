# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
# Luis Penutt

Introduction
================
This project is presented for the purpose of submission in the Cousera Getting and Cleaning Data course. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Required to submit: 

1) a tidy data set
2) a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis, 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed. 
4) a README.md in the repo with the Rscript. 

## Data set is downloaded from:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

## This download contains: 
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0

As described in the "Readme" file in the data set download, the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset is 
a experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
