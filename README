Introduction
================
This project is presented for the purpose of submission in the Cousera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Required to submit: 

1) a tidy data set
2) a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis, 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4) a README.md in the repo with the Rscript. 

## Data set is downloaded from:
